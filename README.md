# ASIA 353 Project: My Bollywood
I'm glad to take this course in 2020W2. Through this course, I have a deeper understanding of Bollywood movies. 
From the movies, I also learned more about the cultural and social background of India.

The discussion part contains my film reviews of Bollywood movies on 12 different topics. The response paper part contains a comparative analysis of these 12 topics. I also attached my final paper whose title is Class Struggle in Bollywood Films in Final Paper part.
