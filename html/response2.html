        <h2>Awara and Mother India Analysis</h2>
        <p>
            The film <em>Awara</em> and <em>Mother India</em> focus on the social rights of the poor, and women from the perspective of the hard life of people at the bottom of society. Their lives are hard, but they are full of hope for a better life, so they work really hard to pursue a greater living condition and higher social status.
            In <em>Awara</em>, we can see that Raj and his mother live in a dilapidated and small house. Under the dim light, the camera focused on the tired and exhausted face of the mother. From this close-up shot, the audience can perceive how difficult the life of the people at the bottom is, especially the woman who raises children alone. Besides, in Mother India, the single mother Radha also lives in a dilapidated and small house with her children. There is a plot when they come across the flood impresses me a lot. They have almost no furniture and even food is extremely scarce, which led to a child starving to death.
            Social justice is another important point in these two movies. In <em>Awara</em>, the director is discussing a thoughtful social issue with the audience: Children born of good folks turn out good and children born of bandits turn out bandits. According to the movie, good and evil do not depend on the identity of the parents, social justice applies to everyone.  In <em>Mother India</em>,
            It is easy to find that social justice just applies to the rich people. Poor people are extremely exploited by landlords and they don't have enough rights to protect themselves. So, both of these two movies show the reality that the people at the bottom cannot get social justice, so the director is calling for social justice via realistic lens.
            Women are strong and hardworking images in both two movies. They raise children alone and live an extremely difficult life. So, they put all their hopes on their children, hoping that they can live a good life when they grow up. In order to realize this dream, they work hard at the expense of their health. For example, in <em>Mother India</em>, Rahda can't afford ox, so she cultivates the land by herself. Therefore, the hard-working female image portrayed by the director shows the strength of women, which praises the dedication of women.
