            The film <em>Deewaar</em> tells the story of two sons of a poor family, who are on two opposite roads because of their different life experiences. Older son Vijay became a criminal and younger son Ravi became a policeman. This is an important dramatic conflict in this movie, which makes the whole movie become a good melodrama.

            The real dilemma builds a tall wall between the criminal brother and the police brother. It is not only a barrier between justice and evil but also an irresistible external force that pushes the two brothers to different sides of life. Even if one person wants to bring them closer, but one person is destined to be submerged by reality. Besides, the dialogue in the film is full of wisdom and philosophy that can give the audience a chance to think deeper.

            The movie's ending is full of justice. But, justice sometimes seems tragic. And behind the tragedy are the hardships of life and human nature. In this movie, Vijay chose to work at the bottom of society in order to reduce the burden on his family at the beginning. And then he started to work in the underworld due to higher salary. After gaining enough money, he wanted to abandon the life in the underworld. However, he became a real criminal due to murder Samant in revenge.
