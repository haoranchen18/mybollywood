        <h2>A life-changing milestone for Rani</h2>
        <p>
            "Europe" is embarking on a significant milestone in Rani's life. Before that, she was a conservative woman who followed family arrangements. And she was also controlled by men at that time to some extent. During the travel, she had some deeper thoughts and expanded her horizons. As an audience, we can see her transformation from a traditional Indian woman to a modern woman.

            Europe is the starting point for Rani to re-understand the world. When travelling in Europe, Rani had more communication with different people. Europe has a more open and tolerant attitude towards women. In Europe, women have fewer restriction and they can have more space and enough rights to fight for their expected future. Women are not attached to men. So, in Europe, Rani could talk to people of different genders without any worries, and even become friends. After talking with many people, she gradually realized that women should also be independent and confident. Women can also have their own careers. Before that, she believed that marrying Vijay is a very satisfying and happy thing. Marrying a man might be the only thing in her mind at that time. But, after deep and comprehensive communication with different people in Europe, she had independent thought and realized that women could also control their life and choose their careers. In Europe, Rani's thoughts had undergone a great change, and she had begun to have an ideological foundation that modern independent women should have.

            The experience of travelling in Europe also gives Rani the ability to think critically. In the beginning, when she was in India, she felt that marrying a man she liked was her biggest goal in life. Marriage and raising a baby may be the only thing women can do. So, when rejected by Vijay, she was heartbroken so that she locked herself in the room for one day. After travelling in Europe, she found that Vijay wanted to go back to her. This time, she rejected Vijay because she had become a modern woman. Both men and women have the right to choose and to be chosen. Regarding the previous extremely conservative thinking, I believe, at this time, Rani was opposed to it. Just as she rejected Vijay's request to reconcile, she rejected her former conservative thinking. She began to be able to control her own future and life.
