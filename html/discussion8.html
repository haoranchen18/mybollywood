            This week's film, <em>Umrao Jaan</em>, mainly describes a courtesan's ill fate. This film is telling a story about courtesan culture, which is very different from the previous film such as Mother India that describes Indian women in another way. The plot that impressed me the most is that when Umrao came back to her hometown, there was an old woman standing in front of her. Even though they were in hesitation in the beginning, they hugged and cried after recognizing that Umrao is the old woman's daughter. Umrao was kidnapped to Lucknow when she was young. After many years, she finally met her mother. I thought her ill fate would end here. However, as she was rejected by her brother, the rhythm of the whole movie was pushed to a climax. Her tragedy is not over yet, ill fate has always been with her. This is a heartbreaking plot. In the previous movie, women's tragedies are often poor in life. For example, <em>Mother India</em> focuses on showing women's independent character to survive in poverty. But in <em>Umrao Jaan</em>, we find that courtesans live a lavish life, and the root of their tragedy and pain is ill fate. It focuses on the courtesan's helplessness in ill fate. They have no choice in their life, but to always struggle in pain. Besides, Courtesan culture is indeed an important and characteristic perspective in Bollywood films. John Caldwell indicates in the article: The courtesan was essential to the film musical because her character could dance and sing when the more modest heroine could not. In <em>Umrao Jaan</em>, we can see a beautiful woman heroine and her wonderful dancing. Facing such beautiful things, the audiences are more likely to perceive the pain that ill fate brings to the heroine.
