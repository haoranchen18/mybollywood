            To begin with, the role of Indian mother Radha symbolizes the independence and strength of women. From the first part of this movie, we can see that Radha is doing housework at home and serving her husband. After the death of her husband, she raised her children alone, despite the numerous sufferings. At the same time, this film also promotes the cultural concept of female loyalty. Although the landlord often harassed Radha, she always resisted strongly to keep herself physically and mentally chaste. These are all plots from the perspective of praising women's independence.

            However, at the end of the movie, because Birju became a bandit, the village's honour was put to shame. So, Radha shot his son to save the honour of the village. From the perspective of a family's mother, I simply cannot understand Radha's approach. In general, the image of a mother's romance, loyalty, dedication and morality can almost all be found in Hinduism.  Compared with the role in the first part of this movie, the role of Radha is not simply a mother of two young sons. She has become the symbol of Indian culture and personification of independent India, but also the builder of modern India and the guardian of traditional values. To some extent, she has promoted the image of Indian women and made "Mother India" a symbol of national spirit.
