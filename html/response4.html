        <h2>"Notion of Angry Young Man" in Bollywood</h2>
        <p>
            The notion of angry young man is a symbol of the common Indian people to express their dissatisfaction with the bitter reality. They can be really angry with the reality, and even themselves, since they are not able to change the results. Their anger can show the hardships of ordinary Indians, and at the same time it can indicate the fact that life is sometimes like a tragedy. Facing the tragedy, the only thing people can do is to bear it. In this despair, people's anger will aggravate the pain. Therefore, the Bollywood movie arouse the audience to think about what caused this tragedy through the description of this desperate life situation of ordinary people.

            In the film, <em>Deewaar</em>, older brother Vijay chose to work in the underworld in order to make more money to improve his family's living condition. The gangster didn't allow him to quit, so they killed his girlfriend. Vijay was very angry and found gangster for revenge. Eventually he killed the gangster. Ravi, little brother of Vijay, was really angry about his brother's behavior because Ravi is a policeman. He could not even understand why his brother would choose to work in the underworld. So, this family's tragedy is due to the social situation. There are limited resources for the lower class people and they have no choice but to do something illegal to improve their lives. Vijay's anger and Ravi's anger could be viewed as the anger towards the bitter reality in the Indian society. As an audience, I will have a deeper thought about the root reason why they are so angry.

            In addition, the movie, <em>Anand</em>, we can also find there is an angry young man. Dr. Bhaskar is a kind doctor. He would help the poor people to have some treatments. But, gradually, he found that he could not cure poverty. Even he was really kind, but he could not help so many people to change their life. So, he was a little angry and sad about himself, since he thought he could not change the current social status of the poor people. Besides, he was angry about Anandâ€™s reaction to the cancer. In the beginning, he could not understand why a dying person could be happy every day. He sympathized with Anand and tried his best to find a way to treat Anand. But he found that all his current efforts were in vain, and when he was upset, Anand's attitude was indeed pleasant. So, Dr. Bhaskar couldn't figure out why he was not wiling to actively cooperate with the doctor's treatment, but was happy every day. At this time, as an audience, I can feel Bhaskar's anger. He was really angry about the cruel reality of life
