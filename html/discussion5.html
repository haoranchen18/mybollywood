            This week's movie, <em>Garm Hawa</em>, clearly shows the tension and conflicts between the Hindu majority and the Muslim minority in India, which is a sensitive and tragic fact in Indian history.  In addition, this movie is unique, since it stands on the perspective of the Muslim minority and shows us the living conditions and internal feelings of the Muslim community at that particular time.

            To begin with, the differences in religious beliefs between Muslims and Hindus led to irreconcilable conflicts between the two communities and this was one of the reasons for the partition of India and Pakistan. In the movie, Salim tried to mortgage the house to save his business. But, he failed due to political reasons. We can see that the Muslim group's rights were gradually restricted. So, they have to make a hard decision: move to Pakistan. I did some research on this large migration during that time: Muslims who were living in Hindu areas fled to Pakistan, while Hindus and Sikhs in Islamic areas fled to India. On both sides of the Radcliffe Line, the large-scale population movements within a short period of time caused chaos.

            Besides, some Muslims insisted on living in India regardless of the oppression and danger. In the movie, Dadi Amma insisted on returning to die in the old house. I think because these people hold an opinion that they would never leave their homeland. Instead, they would fight for their own rights to the end. In fact, this scene could just show us that some Muslims insisted on not leaving and we can also imagine that the Hindus who were living in Pakistan or the border were not willing to move as well. So, tragedy exists in this situation. I googled some materials and I finally learned that the Kashmir conflict appeared due to this reason at that time. In the beginning, 80% of the population were Muslims in that area, but the ruling class in the region had a strong Hindu background. After the withdrawal of British troops, Pakistani troops were deployed there, and Hindu rulers fled back to India. Then India and Pakistan broke out for the first war for Kashmir.
