            This week's film, <em>Shatranj Ke Khiladi</em>, is related to the ruling class and colonizers in India. Facing the invasion of the British colonists, the Indian ruling class remained indifferent, still enjoying life every day. In this movie, there are two representatives of the noblemen, Mir and Mirza. They are obsessed with playing chess all day long. In order to play chess, they disregarded family life and the condition of the country. Even when the Indian ruling class collapsed and the British colonists took over India, they did not fire a single shot. Instead, they fled the city and continued to play chess. At the end of the film, Mir held a chess figure and said "Mr. prime minister, you get aside. Queen Victoria is coming", which is a satirical shot. The director portrayed the ignorance and cowardice of the ruling class in detail.



            After watching this movie, I think the director would like to express a feeling that the ruling class's insensitivity to the development and status of the country caused the country to be colonized. The director used this classic story to imply that the current government should attach importance to national development and not repeat the same mistakes.
