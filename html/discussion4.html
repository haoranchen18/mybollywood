            This movie Anand can give people who are in dilemma lots of inspiration and strength. I like this movie because this movie can bring me a lot of thinking about life.

            In the movie, Anand knows that his life is about to come to an end, he still lives happily every day. At the same time, facing the pity of others, he comforts others not to grieve. He tries his best to make the people around him happy as well. I believe this optimistic spirit let lots of audiences moved. In the movie, he knows that his illness would undoubtedly kill him and there is no means to save his life. Just like he said in the movie: I haven't come here for treatment, I'm here to enjoy my time with all of you. He doesn't want to be sad in the last moments of his life to get the compassion of the people around him. Instead, he wants to stay happy and keep all the people around him optimistic.

            Combined with the knowledge of Bollywood movies in the first week, I think this movie fits the main theme of Bollywood movies. Bollywood movies are the only entertainment for many poor people. So Anand can inspire many poor people and let them find solace in the hard life.
