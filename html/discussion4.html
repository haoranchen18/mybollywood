            After watching and reading the materials this week, I have got basic learning about Indian film and the
            Indian film industry.

            Firstly, after watching the video “Made in Bollywood”, it directly shows me the basic characteristics of
            Bollywood movies. I can perceive that romance, song, dance and color are the most common elements in
            Indian films, which can bring the audience happiness and passion.
            Thus, this is the special and shining part of Indian films compared to other countries’ films.
            As mentioned in the video, Indian films are selling emotions and feelings.

            Besides, the documentary “Bombay Fait Son Cinema” provides lots of precious oral materials about
            Indian films. Cinema is important in people’s daily life and it has become many people’s dreams in India.
            And cinema is cheap entertainment for poor people. This documentary explains why song and dance are the
            most common elements in Indian films. Because they are part of their culture. Even India is influenced by
            western culture, they blend classical dancing and hip pop, which forms Bollywood dance.
            So, I believe that Indian filmmakers’ love for movies, their pride in their own culture,
            and the enthusiasm of ordinary Indians for movies are important reasons for the booming
            Bollywood film industry.

            Also, the BBC interview and reading are showing the developing history of Indian films,
            which also give me a deep impression. As Indian films become more and more international,
            they have slowly developed from a very low budget and high taxes to a larger budget and income.
