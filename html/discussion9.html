            The movie, <em>Satya</em>, is a classic gangster Hindi film. The characters in this movie are diverse and the plot is very attractive. I really enjoy watching this movie because the changes in the relationship between the characters are accompanied by fierce fighting, but also with brotherhood and love. So, in general, the most intriguing part of this movie is that this movie is very realistic. In the beginning, Satya's life was terrible. He had to work as a waiter to make a life. However, he was bullied by the gangsters even in such a bad condition. Anger was full of his mind and he fought back to the gangsters. We can see that Satya is a man full of courage and is also an angry young man and I think this detail implies his final ending. Gradually, he realized that he can have a good life if working in the gangster. Since then, he embarked on a path that cannot be returned. This plot shows us a fact that a person's mind can be changed when he experienced some extremely bad things. And, in common, when he finds that life can be easier if doing some illegal things, he will get deeper into crime. At end of the movie, Satya tried to live a normal life with his lover Vidya, but he found that it was impossible to escape from the underworld. So, finally, his life became a tragedy.  In addition, the brotherhood between Satya and Matre and the romance between Satya and Vidya also add authenticity to the film. These real and emotional elements make this movie closer to our real life.
