        <h2>Bollywood does justice in depicting sexual minorities</h2>
        <p>
            As to this topic, Bollywood does justice in depicting sexual minorities. Through Bollywood movies, such as <em>Aligarh</em>, I will have sympathy for homosexual victims from an audience perspective.

            First of all, Bollywood movies reveal the fact that homosexuals, as sexual minorities, are discriminated against and even persecuted by the public. In Aligarh, people gathered together angrily to resist Siras' behaviours after discovering that Professor Siras is a homosexual. Many people instinctively rebuked, insulted Siras and some of them even wanted to launch an attack against Siras. These are the rejection and suppression of the sexual minorities. However, as a sexual minority, what Prof. Siras can do is just to choose to endure all of these things silently, staying at home and dare not to go out. Ironically, as an academic institution, Aligarh University does not support Professor Siras as well and they also play the role of the sexual majority, resisting Professor Siras's sexual orientation silently by cutting off the electricity in his house. As an audience, I can intuitively feel that in the entire Indian society, both ordinary people and academic institutions have great discrimination and prejudice against homosexuals. Bollywood movies present this cruel fact to us, so I believe Bollywood has done justice on the topic of sexual minorities.

            In addition, this movie also reveals a social issue that people always label others based on the appearance of identity, status, etc. Everyone is a unique individual and has their own characteristics. But modern society always labels people according to categories. For example, in this movie, the male protagonist is labelled as a sexual minority, and this label brings him discrimination. Bollywood movies did not judge that it is right or wrong to label other people. It just shows that in a labelled society, some minority groups have been treated unfairly. As an audience, Bollywood movies can give us some deeper thoughts: each of us may become a minority. If we discriminate against other minorities, we will be discriminated against by others one day. Bollywood films use this social phenomenon to arouse audiences' thinking, thus reflecting the justice of their description of sexual minorities.
