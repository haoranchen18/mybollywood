            This week's movie <em>Omkara</em> is an adaptation of the classic Shakespeare play, Othello. I would like to talk about the reasons why Langda framed up an innocent person resulting in the tragic ending. Firstly, I think it is due to the reality of caste discrimination. Langda himself was very capable of this job, but Kesu won the position because of social status. Kesu was just a very young person with no qualifications. However, Langda was discriminated against by Omkara because of his low caste and lost the desired position, which made him extremely annoyed. Ironically, Omkara's caste was still low and he didn't choose Langda even in this case. So, I can understand why Langda was so angry. The huge differences and unfairness between people escalate people's anger into hatred. Secondly, the power of jealousy is undoubtedly responsible for the tragedies in this movie. Everyone may have dissatisfactions with their work or life. But, how do people react to the unfairness? Obviously, Landa's behavior is extremely harmful to everyone close to him even though he is a victim of caste. In daily life, we may be jealous of other people's achievements or think that others have taken away our opportunities. Envy is human nature, but how to express dissatisfaction and react to the reality is more important. This movie displays that Langda's extreme reactions can indeed ruin everything.
