            This week's film <em>Aligarh</em> is really different from the Bollywood films that we watched before. This is a movie that displays the living conditions of minority people in India. In India, with a strong religious background, people are relatively conservative. When people know that a university professor is gay, people become very angry. It is not difficult to imagine that in a conservative country, India, a person with a high social status did something that violated mainstream values resulting in serious consequences. People went out to protest against Siras's behaviour. And the poor professor had to hide in his home. Even so, the public anger didn't disappear. The electricity in Sira's house was cut off by the university. From this part, we can see people's discrimination against sexual minorities and the unfair treatment they have suffered. Furthermore, after the interview with Deepu, we can find more reasons why Professor Siras was suffering from so much unfair treatment. Although he has been a professor at the University for many years, he has always been regarded as a minority. It is a city where Urdu is spoken, but he teaches Marathi that is a language few people use. Besides, everyone was married, but he was still single even though he was old.  Obviously, the minority is the real identity label of Professor Siras, not only a tag of homosexuality. The content in the movie gave me a lot of thinking. In real life, everyone may become a minority in a certain field. Engaging in special occupations, different skin colors, and unusual behaviors may also be targets of discrimination. These phenomena exist in any country. Even in a relatively diverse country, like Canada, this situation cannot be avoided. For example, the recent BLM or Stop Asian Hate movement in North America are profound examples. Sometimes I am thinking that some governments regard respecting a certain minority group as being politically correct, which is also a form of discrimination. I don't know if this is correct. But I think at least from the education of students from an early age, people should realize that there are differences between people, especially the differences between a small group of people and the majority of people. We should respect this difference instead of treating minority groups in an exclusive and slanderous manner because we must know that sometimes we ourselves are also minority groups in some fields. People's discrimination against others will one day turn into discrimination against themselves.
