        <h2>My sympathy for Satya</h2>
        <p>
            First of all, I am very sympathetic to Satya. In my opinion, he is a poor man and his life is like a tragedy. I have two main reasons that he deserves my sympathy.

            The first reason I want to mention is he is a victim of society and era. The cruel reality forces him to do illegal things. He is an orphan with no family help and no educational background. In the beginning, he could only do the most basic work, being a waiter. He wanted to support himself by earning more salary through his hard work. However, the social reality is cruel. He was bullied by gangsters while working as a waiter. He fought against the gangsters to protect himself. But because of his resistance, the gangsters bullied him even more seriously. When he was almost helpless, his era and society did not give him any help, and he could no longer earn enough living expenses by being a waiter. Therefore, he had no choice but to work in the underworld and do illegal things to make money. So, I feel sympathy for Satya's helplessness in his society and era.

            Secondly, he sank deeper and deeper into the underworld and could not return, which makes me feel sympathy. When people do wrong things, they always want to be forgiven and long for a chance to correct the faults. But not every mistake can be forgiven. When Satya embarked on the road of the underworld, the tragic end of life seemed destined to accompany him throughout his life, since what he did went beyond the red line of the law. But when I see him struggling to escape from the underworld, I feel very sympathetic. Satya is a very strong and faithful man. He should have had a great life, but because he wrongly chose the path of crime, he was doomed to be a tragedy. Besides, there are some emotional elements in this movie. The brotherhood between Satya and Matre and love between Satya and Vidya. He fell in love with Vidya and planned to escape from the underworld and make a normal life with Vidya. Meanwhile, he chose to take revenge due to brotherhood. Unfortunately, it makes him to the deeper level of the underworld and finally, he paid the price of life. This plot makes me feel more sympathy for Satya.
