        <h2>Analyze the relationship between Anand and Dr. Bhaskar</h2>
        <p>
            The film <em>Anand</em> depicts an optimistic man, Anand, who has cancer and will die soon. Although Dr. Bhaskar is kind-hearted, he cannot save many poor peoples life. So, Dr. Bhaskar holds some pessimistic attitudes towards life. However, the appearance of Anand changed his life and impacted him a lot. In my opinion, Anand is Dr. Bhaskar's best friend and also his life mentor.

            Anand is Dr. Bhaskar's life mentor. At the beginning, Dr. Bhaskar could not understand why Anand is able to be happy every day when he knew that he has cancer and was near to death. He sympathized with Anand, but felt helpless for his inability to heal Anand. Gradually, Dr. Bhaskar found that Anand can give all people around him happiness and he was also influenced by this optimistic spirit Anand gave Dr. Bhaskar's life enlightenment and gave him a new understanding of life and death. Dr. Bhaskar realized that he could not save everyone in this world and everyone needs to face death or other difficulties during life. In the midst of hardship, people should always maintain an optimistic attitude like Anand. Since the status of life cannot be changed, it is better to do things that are beneficial to people in the last time of life. There is a scene that Anand was in the doctor's house and he was singing and playing the piano to cheer everyone. The lyrics Treasure every moment that has passed little things are most cherished. Bad nights have to be dealt with carefully. Ushered in a beautiful morning. is also a good point and detail of this movie which can show Anand's happy spirit and arouse audience's thoughts about their own life.

            At the same time, they are best friends. Anand helped to change Dr. Bhaskar's ordinary life. Anand discovered that Bhaskar has strong feelings for Renu who was a patient of Bhaskar. And Bhaskar is a quiet person and he is not good at expressing his love. So, Anand helped Bhaskar express his love and convinces Renu's mother to support their marriage. When Anand died, Bhaskar was sad, but he knew that Anand would live in his life forever. Just like the sentence in the movie: Anand doesn't die. Such people never die.
