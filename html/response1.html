        <h2>My perception of Bollywood</h2>
        <p>
            Bollywood film is a symbol of Indian culture. After getting a basic learning about Bollywood film, I will elaborate on three points of my thoughts on Bollywood movies in my paper below.

            To begin with, I would like to focus on the distinct elements of Bollywood films. According to the learning materials, it is impressed that Bollywood films are full of dance, song, color and romance. These films usually bring happiness and satisfaction to people, so it is not hard to find that Bollywood films are selling emotions and feelings to the audience. Through the study of the film class materials, I learned for the first time that an important reason is that watching films is a cheap way to get entertainment and these happy elements can make the poor people find a little joy in the bitter life. Meanwhile, these lively elements, such as song and dance, are part of Indian culture and the elements are also reflective of the vibrant country.

            Besides, Indian movies are international. Firstly, Indian movies are influenced by Western culture. With the development of globalization, Indian films have also been influenced by culture from other countries. Once upon a time, Indian dance was traditional in the movies. However, after being influenced by Western culture, Bollywood mixed hip-hop and traditional elements to form a unique Bollywood dance, which makes Bollywood films internationally appealing. If the film only has its own local culture and elements, it will cause audience groups in other countries to not understand and limit the expansion of the film industry. Bollywood cleverly combined the local culture and Western culture to form a unique movie style acceptable to audiences on both sides. Secondly, India has a large English-speaking population that helps Bollywood create a close relationship the film industry of Western countries, which has given the Bollywood film industry a large international market. At the same time, this can also provide Bollywood movies with a good platform for international cooperation and more investment budgets.

            Also, Bollywood movies can play a role in unifying the national spirit of India. Firstly, many Bollywood films' language is Hindi that is also the first language in India. Movies are important in people's daily life and films have even become many peopleâ€™s dream. Therefore, a large number of Bollywood Hindi films can give Indians of different cultures the same spiritual core. Furthermore, Bollywood movies have a huge audience in North America. The reason is that many Indian immigrants live in the North American continent. They still watch Bollywood movies, so their children will be influenced by the Indian culture. Thus, these children born in North America will more or less have a spiritual resonance with India.
