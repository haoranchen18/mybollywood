            This week's film, <em>Queen</em>, is a good movie related to the Indian women genre.
            Compared with the previous watched movie, <em>Mother India</em>, Rani is more independent and modern than
            the heroine in <em>Mother India</em>. We can see a transformation of traditional Indian women to modern women.
            In <em>Queen</em>, Rani was a conservative woman who followed family arrangements before travelling abroad.
            She has never thought about taking control of her future or she has thought about it but has no confidence.
            At that time, she thought that marrying Vijay is a very satisfying thing. Because of this, when she was
            rejected by Vijay, she was so sad so that she locked herself in the room for one day. However, at this time,
            the thought of controlling her future life gradually formed in her mind. Thus, she began to travel abroad
            and during the journey, she became more and more independent and open-mind.
            Meanwhile, Rani began to realize that she also has the potentials in earning money so that she can be
            financially independent. Generally, this film shows the audience how a traditional Indian woman transforms
            into a modern woman. In <em>Mother India</em>, the heroine is very brave and determined.
            She is a representative of
            independent women in India. But she has never been separated from the social arrangements for her, from
            beginning to end, she has no control over her life and future. She didn't even have a chance to choose.
            The huge difference in the lives of the two women is obviously determined by the process of social
            development. From the experience of the two heroines, we can find the change of portraying female
            characters in Bollywood movies. At the same time, we can also see the development of the entire Indian
            society.
