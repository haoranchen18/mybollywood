            Generally, the film, <em>Awaara</em>, is indeed a classical and thoughtful Bollywood style movie. The film depicts the dark reality of the Indian hierarchical society and praises pure love and humanitarianism. Director Raj Kapoor combines the plots of family tragedies, romantic love and human stereotypes, integrating Indian traditional song and dance and popular drama to create a special distinct style of Bollywood movies. Furthermore, this film metaphors the deformed caste system in Indian society and criticizes the lineage theory that "Judge's son is born to be a judge, and the son of a bandit must be a bandit".

            Besides, this movie was very popular in China due to the background of huge social changes, such as the Cultural Revolution and Chinese Land Reform. Although I'm from China, the young people in China have not experienced that bitter and difficult time, the older generation sometimes talk about the past years to their grandchildren. I would like to share my family's story, which can furtherly explain the reason why this movie was so popular in China. I remember that when I was a middle school student, my grandmother told me that her family was a landlord family until 1952, and due to the new regime's land reform policy, all their lands were nationalized. So, throughout China, the children of capitalists, landlords and some senior officials were labelled bad guys. Even the rights of going to school and getting married were restricted. Only peasants and workers were labelled good guys at that time, so their children had lots of social priorities. Therefore, my grandmother failed to go to university even though her grades were very good. Since 1978, China has implemented a policy of reform and opening up. The government loosened previous restrictions and people's lives have gradually improved. It was also at this time the movie was released in China. There is no doubt that the movie was extremely popular in China since people like my grandmother had deep thoughts about the sentence in the movie: Judge's son is born to be a judge, and the son of a bandit must be a bandit. They are extremely grateful for the reform and opening-up policy and at the same time reflect on the misfortunes they encountered. Therefore, the film's release may be a public reflection on past policies after reforming.
